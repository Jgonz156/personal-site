This homework assignment is about managing system expectations, processes, and scheduling!
You are going to be programming the heart of an operating system: the scheduler!

<ReadingSection points={0}>

The sections below give you direct and indirect help with organizing your thoughts about scheduling, batch systems, interactive systems, and real-time systems.

<QuestionBox qid="R1">

In "The Rust Language Book" read:
- Ch 8: Common Collections
- Ch 13: Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures

These chapters will help with familiarizing yourself with the type of data structures you will be working with in
the programming assignment.

<QuestionBox qid="R2">

Read Chapter 3: Scheduling (Page 45-92) from our course textbook. Its provides a great 
overiew of the concerns, concepts, and algorithms for scheduling in operating systems.
Whilst it specifies thread scheduling, the concepts are applicable to process scheduling as well.
