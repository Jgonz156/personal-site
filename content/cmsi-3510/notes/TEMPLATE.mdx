## Introduction

Brief introduction paragraph explaining what this lecture covers.

> **MDX Note**: When writing set notation like \{1, 2, 3\}, always escape curly braces with backslashes!  
> **Math Note**: When using `\text{...}` in LaTeX, escape the braces: `\text\{...\}` to avoid MDX parsing issues.

## Section 1: Main Topic

Start with the core concepts. Use clear headings to organize your content.

### Subsection

Break down complex topics into manageable pieces.

> **Key Insight**: Use blockquotes for important notes and insights.

## Examples

Show concrete examples to illustrate concepts:

### Example 1: Basic Case

```javascript
// You can include code examples in any language
function example() {
  return "This is a code block"
}
```

### Example 2: Advanced Case

You can also show mathematical notation directly:

- Let x ∈ ℕ
- Then x² ≥ 0
- Therefore ∀x ∈ ℕ, x² ≥ 0

## Visual Aids

### Tables

Tables are great for comparing concepts:

| Concept | Definition    | Example   |
| ------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Term A  | Description A | Example A |
| Term B  | Description B | Example B |
| Term C  | Description C | Example C |

### Lists

**Ordered lists** for sequences:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

**Unordered lists** for collections:

- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

---

## Important Formulas

You can write formulas inline or as blocks. For complex math, you might want to use:

- Inline: Let f(x) = x² + 2x + 1
- Block formulas can be written out clearly with spacing

**Key Formulas**:

```
Sum formula: Σ(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2

Product formula: n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
```

## Practice Problems

Include practice problems to reinforce learning.

### Problem 1: Basic Application

State the problem clearly.

**Hint**: Provide helpful hints in bold.

### Problem 2: Intermediate

Build on previous concepts.

### Problem 3: Challenge

Push students to think deeper.
