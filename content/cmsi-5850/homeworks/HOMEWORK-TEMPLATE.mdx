  HOMEWORK TEMPLATE
  =================
  
  The intro section (title, due date, topics, description) is now rendered 
  AUTOMATICALLY by the page component using data from data.ts.
  
  To add a new homework:
  1. Create hwX.mdx in the homeworks folder
  2. Add the homework event to lib/courses/cmsi-5850/data.ts with all metadata:
     - hwTopics: string[]
     - hwPoints: { written?, programming?, reading?, optional? }
     - hwGithubClassroomUrl?: string
     - hwBrightspaceUrl?: string
  3. Write the actual content below using WrittenSection, ProgrammingSection, etc.
  
  NO NEED to export metadata or use HomeworkIntro in MDX anymore!
