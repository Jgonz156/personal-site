<QuestionBox qid="Q3" points={8}>

We discussed previously how performing logic was contained within performing algebra on the integers. Put another way we discovered that the operations of the logical connectives were the same as the arithmetic operations on the integers 1 and 0. Explain how a similar relationship exists from the arithmetic operations on the integers to the operations of sets. Put another way, how might the operations of sets be thought of as superseding the arithmetic operations on the integers?

## Abstract Algebra in Your Hobbies

The creative endeavor I am suggesting for the Numbers standard is the same as with the Logic standard, integrate your learning into a real world event/experience/memory! (However always remember that you can work out an alternate creative endeavour if you want to involve your hobbies! You can make creative works in any form such as games, drawings, paintings, dioramas, sculptures, videos, fake blogs, memes, anything!) (For instance, while I am working on this HW I am remembering what it was like to visit the grand canyon! Want to break down a hiking trail into Venn diagrams? Create your own rock climbing beta guided by the integers? Go for it!) (Just make sure to talk to me first!)

We saw in class that Numbers, while being an instance in their own right, were a "cover" of sorts for a large world of abstract algebra. We were able to perform what we typically know as "addition" without numbers at all! With that said, the creative endeavor I am suggesting for the number standard is to find abstract algebraic operations in your hobbies!

### Finding Abstract Algebra in Your Hobbies

How do you find abstract algebra in your hobbies? Well, consider what it really means to be associative or commutative and see if you can find that in the interactions of your hobbies! For instance:

- If you are a **dancer**, you could consider the commutative property in the way moves lead into one another!
- If you are a **musician**, you could consider the associative property in the way you play your instrument!
- Does your hobby include addition or subtraction? What about closure?

### Your Task

Take your abstract algebraic patterns in your hobby and write to me about how they inherently display the properties of abstract algebra! Then try and create a collection of "arithmetic" operations within your hobby!

For instance, I enjoy rock climbing, and a sample process would be potentially investigating the link between addition and combining climbs together that are next to each other. I could even investigate if "down climbing" is a form of beta negation! I could then try and find see if there are ways in which I can rock climb that seem to represent subtraction!

**The more properties you include and the more operations you find, the more points you earn!**

**This optional project can be submitted until one week after the homework due date.**
