  HOMEWORK TEMPLATE
  =================
  
  The intro section (title, due date, topics, description) is now rendered 
  AUTOMATICALLY by the page component using data from data.ts.
  
  To add a new homework:
  1. Create hwX.mdx in the homeworks folder
  2. Add the homework event to lib/courses/cmsi-2820/data.ts with all metadata:
     - hwTopics: string[]
     - hwPoints: { written?, programming?, reading?, optional? }
     - hwGithubClassroomUrl?: string
     - hwBrightspaceUrl?: string
  3. Write the actual content below using WrittenSection, ProgrammingSection, etc.
  
  NO NEED to export metadata or use HomeworkIntro in MDX anymore!

{/* MDX BEST PRACTICES FOR MATH AND TABLES:

1. INLINE MATH: Use $...$ for inline math expressions
   Example: $\lambda x. x$ or $A \rightarrow B$

2. BLOCK MATH: Use $$...$$ for display math (centered equations)
   Example:
   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   $$

3. AVOID \begin{matrix}, \begin{cases}, and other complex LaTeX environments
   These often contain curly braces {} that MDX tries to parse as JSX.

4. USE MARKDOWN TABLES for structured data:
   | Variable | Value |
   | -------- | ----- |
   | $A$      | True  |
   | $B$      | False |

5. CODE BLOCKS: Use triple backticks with language specification
