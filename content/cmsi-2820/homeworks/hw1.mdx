Submit your answers to the following questions on paper. Show all your work and clearly explain your reasoning.

## Question 1: Truth Tables (15 points)

Construct complete truth tables for the following propositions:

a) $(P \land Q) \lor (\neg P \land R)$

b) $(P \rightarrow Q) \land (Q \rightarrow R)$

c) $\neg(P \lor Q) \leftrightarrow (\neg P \land \neg Q)$

For each truth table, identify whether the proposition is a tautology, contradiction, or contingency.

## Question 2: Logical Equivalence (20 points)

Prove that the following pairs of propositions are logically equivalent using logical equivalence laws (do not use truth tables):

a) $\neg(P \rightarrow Q) \equiv P \land \neg Q$

b) $(P \lor Q) \land (\neg P \lor R) \equiv (P \land R) \lor (Q \land \neg P) \lor (Q \land R)$

**Hint**: For part (b), you may find it helpful to use the distributive law and De Morgan's laws.

## Question 3: Boolean Simplification (15 points)

Simplify the following boolean expressions using boolean algebra laws. Show each step and cite the law you used.

a) $(A \land B) \lor (A \land \neg B)$

b) $\neg(\neg A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)$

c) $(A \land B \land C) \lor (A \land B \land \neg C) \lor (\neg A \land B \land C)$

## Question 4: Proofs (10 points)

Using the rules of inference (Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, etc.), prove the following argument is valid:

**Premises:**

1. $P \rightarrow Q$
2. $Q \rightarrow R$
3. $P$

**Conclusion:** $R$

## Build a Logic Circuit Simulator

For extra credit, create a physical or digital logic circuit that implements a simple logical expression of your choice. You can use:

- **Physical Option**: Build a circuit using LEDs, switches, and logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) on a breadboard
- **Digital Option**: Create an interactive web-based logic circuit simulator using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Requirements:

1. Your circuit must implement at least one compound logical expression with 3 or more gates
2. Document your circuit with a diagram showing the gate connections
3. Demonstrate that your circuit correctly evaluates the expression for all input combinations
4. Write a brief reflection (1-2 paragraphs) explaining what you learned

### Submission:

- For physical circuits: Submit photos/video of your working circuit along with your documentation
- For digital circuits: Submit a link to your hosted simulator or a zip file with the code
- Include your written reflection and circuit diagram in a PDF

**This extra credit project can be submitted until one week after the homework due date.**
