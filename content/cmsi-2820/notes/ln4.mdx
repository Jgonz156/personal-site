# Using Interactive Components in MDX

This is an example showing how you can embed interactive React components directly in your MDX lecture notes!

## Basic Interactive Example

Here's a simple counter component embedded in the lecture:

<InteractiveExample />

## Educational Interactive Components

### Truth Table Practice

You can create interactive practice problems for your students:

<TruthTableDemo />

## Collapsible Definitions

Use expandable sections to keep your content organized:

<DefinitionBox term="Discrete Mathematics">
  Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are
  fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It includes topics like logic,
  set theory, graph theory, and combinatorics.
</DefinitionBox>

<DefinitionBox term="Proposition">
  A proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not
  both. Examples include "2 + 2 = 4" (true) and "The sky is green" (false).
</DefinitionBox>

<DefinitionBox term="Truth Table">
  A truth table is a mathematical table used to determine if a compound
  statement is true or false based on the truth values of its simple statements.
</DefinitionBox>

## How to Use These Components

To use interactive components in your MDX files:

1. **Import the component** at the top of your MDX file:

   ```mdx
   import { InteractiveExample } from "@/components/interactive-example

   "
   ```

2. **Use the component** anywhere in your content:

   ```mdx
   <InteractiveExample />
   ```

3. **Pass props** if the component accepts them:
   ```mdx
   <DefinitionBox term="Your Term">Your definition here...</DefinitionBox>
   ```

## Creating Your Own Components

You can create custom interactive components for your specific needs:

### Ideas for Discrete Math Components:

- **Set Visualizer**: Interactive Venn diagrams
- **Graph Builder**: Let students create and analyze graphs
- **Logic Simulator**: Test logical expressions
- **Proof Checker**: Step-by-step proof validation
- **Combinatorics Calculator**: Interactive counting problems
- **Truth Table Generator**: Auto-generate tables from expressions

### Component Guidelines:

- Use `"use client"` directive for interactive components
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add clear labels and instructions
- Provide immediate feedback for student actions
- Make components accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Regular Markdown Still Works!

You can mix interactive components with regular markdown:

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

### Tables

| Operator | Symbol | Example |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| AND      | âˆ§      | P âˆ§ Q   |
| OR       | âˆ¨      | P âˆ¨ Q   |
| NOT      | Â¬      | Â¬P      |

## Best Practices

1. **Don't overuse interactivity** - Use it where it adds value
2. **Keep it simple** - Complex interactions can be distracting
3. **Provide alternatives** - Not all students learn the same way
4. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure components work on mobile devices
5. **Consider accessibility** - Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
