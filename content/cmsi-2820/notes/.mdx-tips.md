# MDX Writing Tips

## Important: Curly Braces in MDX

In MDX, curly braces `{}` are reserved for JavaScript expressions. When you want to display literal curly braces (like in set notation), you **must** escape them with backslashes.

### ❌ Wrong (causes parse errors):

```mdx
Let A = {1, 2, 3}
Domain = {2k | k ∈ ℤ}
```

### ✅ Correct:

```mdx
Let A = \{1, 2, 3\}
Domain = \{2k | k ∈ ℤ\}
```

### Alternative: Use inline code

If you're writing mathematical notation that includes braces, you can also use inline code:

```mdx
Let A = `{1, 2, 3}`
Domain = `{2k | k ∈ ℤ}`
```

## Other Special Characters

- **Less than / Greater than**: `<` and `>` are fine in regular text, but if they're followed by text without spaces, MDX might interpret them as JSX tags. Use `\<` and `\>` or code blocks if needed.
- **Asterisks**: Already work fine for bold/italic, but if you need literal asterisks for math (like multiplication), use `\*` or code blocks.

## Common Mathematical Expressions

### Set Notation

```mdx
- Empty set: ∅ or \{\}
- Set with elements: \{1, 2, 3\}
- Set builder: \{x | x > 0\}
- Set with 2k: \{2k | k ∈ ℤ\}
```

### Functions

```mdx
- Function definition: f(x) = x² (no braces, works fine)
- Domain/Range: D = \{all real numbers\}
```

### Logic

```mdx
- Propositions: P, Q, R (works fine)
- Sets: A = \{true, false\}
```

## When in Doubt

If you're unsure whether something will parse correctly:

1. **Use inline code**: Wrap it in backticks `` `like this` ``
2. **Use code blocks**: For longer expressions
3. **Escape special characters**: Add a backslash `\` before `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`

## Testing Your MDX

After creating or editing an MDX file:

1. Save the file
2. Check the terminal for errors
3. Visit the page in your browser
4. If you see "Could not parse expression with acorn", look for unescaped curly braces

## Quick Reference

| Character | When to Escape           | Example                              |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---- | -------- |
| `{` `}`   | Always in text           | `\{1, 2, 3\}`                        |
| `<` `>`   | When followed by letters | Usually fine, but use `\<` if needed |
| `*`       | When not for emphasis    | Usually fine for math                |
| `         | `                        | Inside braces                        | `\{x | x > 0\}` |

Remember: **When writing set notation in mathematical contexts, always escape your curly braces!**
