# Propositional Logic

Building on our introduction, we now explore the formal system of **propositional logic** - the foundation of all logical reasoning in mathematics and computer science.

## What is a Proposition?

A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either **true** or **false**, but not both.

### Examples of Propositions ✅

- "2 + 2 = 4" (True)
- "The earth is flat" (False)
- "Python is a programming language" (True)
- "10 is an odd number" (False)

### NOT Propositions ❌

- "What time is it?" (Question)
- "Close the door!" (Command)
- "x + 3 = 7" (Depends on x - this is a **predicate**)
- "This statement is false" (Paradox)

## Logical Operators

We combine propositions using **logical operators**:

### 1. Negation (NOT) - $\neg$

The negation of $P$ is "not $P$"

| $P$ | $\neg P$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |

Example:

- $P$: "It is raining"
- $\neg P$: "It is not raining"

### 2. Conjunction (AND) - $\land$

$P \land Q$ is true only when **both** $P$ and $Q$ are true

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \land Q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T           |
| T   | F   | F           |
| F   | T   | F           |
| F   | F   | F           |

### 3. Disjunction (OR) - $\lor$

$P \lor Q$ is true when **at least one** of $P$ or $Q$ is true

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \lor Q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | T          |
| F   | T   | T          |
| F   | F   | F          |

### 4. Implication (IF-THEN) - $\to$

$P \to Q$ means "if $P$, then $Q$"

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \to Q$ |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | T         |
| F   | F   | T         |

> **Important**: An implication is only false when the hypothesis ($P$) is true and the conclusion ($Q$) is false!

### 5. Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF) - $\leftrightarrow$

$P \leftrightarrow Q$ means $P$ and $Q$ have the same truth value

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \leftrightarrow Q$ |
| --- | --- | --------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                     |
| T   | F   | F                     |
| F   | T   | F                     |
| F   | F   | T                     |

## Truth Tables

Truth tables help us analyze complex logical expressions.

### Example: $(P \lor Q) \land \neg R$

Let's build the full truth table:

| $P$ | $Q$ | $R$ | $P \lor Q$ | $\neg R$ | $(P \lor Q) \land \neg R$ |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T   | T          | F        | F                         |
| T   | T   | F   | T          | T        | T                         |
| T   | F   | T   | T          | F        | F                         |
| T   | F   | F   | T          | T        | T                         |
| F   | T   | T   | T          | F        | F                         |
| F   | T   | F   | T          | T        | T                         |
| F   | F   | T   | F          | F        | F                         |
| F   | F   | F   | F          | T        | F                         |

## Logical Equivalence

Two expressions are **logically equivalent** if they have the same truth value for all possible inputs.

Notation: $P \equiv Q$

### Important Equivalences

**De Morgan's Laws**:

$$
\neg(P \land Q) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg Q
$$

$$
\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv \neg P \land \neg Q
$$

**Double Negation**:

$$
\neg(\neg P) \equiv P
$$

**Conditional Identity**:

$$
P \to Q \equiv \neg P \lor Q
$$

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Truth Table

Construct a complete truth table for: $(P \to Q) \land (Q \to R)$

### Problem 2: Logical Equivalence

Prove that $P \to Q$ is logically equivalent to $\neg Q \to \neg P$ (the contrapositive)

### Problem 3: De Morgan's Law

Simplify: $\neg((A \land B) \lor (C \land D))$

### Problem 4: Real World Application

Translate to logical notation:
"If you study hard and attend class, then you will pass the course."

Let:

- S = "You study hard"
- A = "You attend class"
- P = "You will pass the course"

## Coming Up Next

In Lecture 3, we'll extend our logic system to **predicate logic**, which allows us to reason about properties of objects and quantify statements with $\forall$ (for all) and $\exists$ (there exists).
