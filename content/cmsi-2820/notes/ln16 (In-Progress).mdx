## What is Combinatorics?

Combinatorics is the mathematics of **counting**. While that might sound simple, the questions we ask quickly become fascinating:

- How many different ways can you arrange 5 books on a shelf?
- If you flip a coin 10 times, how many different sequences could you see?
- How many possible passwords are there with 8 characters?
- How many ways can you choose 3 students from a class of 30?

These aren't just academic puzzles, they're the foundation of probability theory, computer science algorithms, cryptography, and much more!

Counting is a general problem found in many different areas of mathematics. Sometimes we are counting the number of
possible polygons in geometry, the number of rectangles we can fit under a curve in calculus, or even how many times we
run certain lines of code to determine the complexity of an algorithm.

As it turns out there are many different ways to count and on top of that there are many things we choose not to count. Below, lets
define four major categories of "counting" problems:

- Enumeration Problems: Counting a number of objects
- Existential/Selection Problems: Locating a specific object amongst others
- Construction Problems: Constructing an object from others
- Optimization Problems: Finding the best object amongst others

These don't sound so bad, but we lack formal mechanisms to proceduralize the solving of problems in these areas.

Whilst solving these problems as a human is relatively straightforward, we need to rely on the previous primitives, properties, and operations
we investigated previously to ensure we can get Computers to solve these problems.

Before we can decide which of our previous tools to use, lets first familiarize ourselves with some Enumeration problems!

## Enumeration

Enumeration problems fundamentally rely of a few important rules that we will investigate in turn:

- Disjoint Sets
- The Rule of Sums
- The Rule of Products
- The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

## The Fundamental Counting Principles

### The Rule of Sums (Addition Principle)

If you have to make a choice between **disjoint** options (meaning you can only pick one), you **add** the number of ways to do each.

<LectureNotes>

**The Rule of Sums**: If task A can be done in $m$ ways and task B can be done in $n$ ways, and **you can't do both**, then you can do either A or B in $m + n$ ways.

**Key requirement**: The sets must be **disjoint** (no overlap)!

</LectureNotes>

#### Example 1: Choosing a Dessert

At a restaurant, you can choose:

- 3 types of ice cream, OR
- 4 types of cake

How many dessert options do you have?

**Solution**: Since you can only choose one dessert, we use the Rule of Sums:

$$3 + 4 = 7 \text\{ dessert options\}$$

---

### The Rule of Products (Multiplication Principle)

If you have to make **multiple independent choices in sequence**, you **multiply** the number of ways to do each.

<LectureNotes>

**The Rule of Products**: If task A can be done in $m$ ways and task B can be done in $n$ ways, and **you must do both**, then you can do A followed by B in $m \times n$ ways.

**Key requirement**: The choices must be **independent** of each other!

</LectureNotes>

#### Example 2: Making an Outfit

You're getting dressed and need to choose:

- One of 5 shirts
- One of 3 pairs of pants

How many different outfits can you make?

**Solution**: You must make both choices, so we use the Rule of Products:

$$5 \times 3 = 15 \text\{ possible outfits\}$$

---

## Disjoint Sets

Two sets are **disjoint** if they have no elements in common. This is crucial for the Rule of Sums!

| Sets                         | Disjoint? | Why?               |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| \{1, 2, 3\} and \{4, 5, 6\}  | ✅ Yes    | No shared elements |
| \{1, 2, 3\} and \{3, 4, 5\}  | ❌ No     | Both contain 3     |
| Even numbers and Odd numbers | ✅ Yes    | No number is both  |

> **Important**: When using the Rule of Sums, always verify your sets are disjoint! If they overlap, you'll overcount.

---

## Combining the Rules

Most real problems require using **both** rules together!

### Example 3: Password Strength

A simple password must:

- Start with a letter (26 choices)
- Then have a digit (10 choices)
- Then have another letter (26 choices)

How many passwords are possible?

**Solution**: We need to make all three choices, so multiply:

$$26 \times 10 \times 26 = 6,760 \text\{ possible passwords\}$$

### Example 4: Travel Plans

You're planning a trip and need to decide:

1. **Transportation**: Drive (1 way) OR Fly (3 airlines to choose from)
2. **Hotel**: 4 hotels available

How many ways can you plan your trip?

**Solution**:

- First, count transportation options: $1 + 3 = 4$ ways (Rule of Sums)
- Then, multiply by hotel choices: $4 \times 4 = 16$ total plans (Rule of Products)

---

## Practice Problems

Try these to test your understanding!

### Problem 1: Restaurant Menu

A restaurant offers:

- 5 appetizers
- 8 main courses
- 3 desserts

If you must order all three courses, how many different meals can you create?

<details>
<summary>**Show Solution**</summary>

You must make all three choices, so use the Rule of Products:

$$5 \times 8 \times 3 = 120 \text\{ different meals\}$$

</details>

### Problem 2: License Plates

A license plate consists of:

- 3 letters (A-Z)
- Followed by 3 digits (0-9)

How many different license plates are possible?

<details>
<summary>**Show Solution**</summary>

Each position is an independent choice:

$$26 \times 26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 17,576,000 \text\{ license plates\}$$

Or more concisely: $26^3 \times 10^3$

</details>

### Problem 3: Committee Selection (Challenge)

You need to form a 2-person committee from a group of:

- 4 seniors
- 5 juniors

The committee must have people from the same class (both seniors OR both juniors). How many ways can you form the committee?

> **Hint**: This combines both rules! First figure out how many ways to pick 2 from each class, then add.

<details>
<summary>**Show Solution**</summary>

- Ways to pick 2 seniors: $4 \times 3 = 12$ ways (first pick × second pick)
- Ways to pick 2 juniors: $5 \times 4 = 20$ ways
- Total: $12 + 20 = 32$ ways (Rule of Sums - they're disjoint options)

_Note: We'll learn a better formula for this type of problem soon!_

</details>

## Key Takeaways

- **Rule of Sums**: Add when you choose **one option from disjoint sets**
- **Rule of Products**: Multiply when you make **multiple independent choices**
- **Disjoint sets** have no overlap - essential for the Rule of Sums
- Most problems require **combining both rules**
- Always think: "Am I choosing OR doing?" (add) vs "Am I choosing AND doing?" (multiply)

## Coming Up Next

In the next lecture, we'll dive deeper into counting with:

- **Factorials** ($n!$) - for counting arrangements
- **Permutations** - ordered selections
- **Combinations** - unordered selections

Get ready for the classic question: "What's the difference between permutations and combinations?" 🎲
