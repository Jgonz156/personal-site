# GitHub Flavored Markdown Examples

This file demonstrates all the GitHub Flavored Markdown features available in your MDX lectures.

## Tables

### Basic Table

| Operator | Symbol | Description         |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| AND      | ∧      | Logical AND         |
| OR       | ∨      | Logical OR          |
| NOT      | ¬      | Logical negation    |
| IMPLIES  | →      | Logical implication |

### Table with Alignment

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| P            |       Q        |         P ∧ Q |
| T            |       T        |             T |
| T            |       F        |             F |
| F            |       T        |             F |
| F            |       F        |             F |

### Truth Table Example

| P   | Q   | ¬P  | ¬Q  | P ∧ Q | P ∨ Q | P → Q | P ↔ Q |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| T   | T   | F   | F   | T     | T     | T     | T     |
| T   | F   | F   | T   | F     | T     | F     | F     |
| F   | T   | T   | F   | F     | T     | T     | F     |
| F   | F   | T   | T   | F     | F     | T     | T     |

## Strikethrough

Use two tildes for strikethrough:

- ~~This is incorrect~~
- This is correct ✓

You can also use it mid-sentence: The answer is ~~42~~ 43.

---

## Autolinks

URLs and emails are automatically converted to links:

- Visit https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm for more info
- Email me at professor@university.edu
- Check out www.example.com

No need to write `[text](url)` syntax!

---

## Footnotes

Here's a statement with a footnote reference[^1].

You can have multiple footnotes in a document[^2].

Footnotes can contain **formatted text** and even code[^code].

[^1]: This is the first footnote. It can contain multiple paragraphs and other markdown.
[^2]: This is the second footnote. Footnotes are automatically numbered and linked.
[^code]: Footnotes can even contain code blocks:

    ```javascript
    function example() {
      return "Hello from a footnote!"
    }
    ```

## Tasklists

### Student Todo List

- [ ] Read Chapter 1: Introduction to Logic
- [x] Complete Exercise Set 1.1
- [x] Watch lecture video
- [ ] Submit homework by Friday
- [ ] Study for exam

### Progress Tracker

**Week 1 Topics:**

- [x] Propositional logic

## Combining Features

You can combine all these features together:

### Example: Set Theory Progress

| Concept          | Completed | Notes                     |
| :--------------- | :-------: | :------------------------ |
| Basic operations |    [x]    | Union, intersection, etc. |
| Venn diagrams    |    [x]    | Visual representations    |
| Set identities   |    [ ]    | ~~Due today~~ Due Friday  |
| Power sets       |    [ ]    | See Chapter 2.4[^chapter] |

[^chapter]: Chapter 2.4 covers power sets and their properties.

### Example: Homework Status

1. **Problem Set 1**: ~~In progress~~ ✓ Complete
2. **Problem Set 2**: In progress
3. **Problem Set 3**: Not started
4. Links to resources: https://www.khanacademy.org/math

## Tips for Using GFM in Your Lectures

### Tables

- Use tables for truth tables, operation definitions, and comparisons
- Align numeric columns to the right, text to the left, and symbols to center
- Keep tables reasonably sized for mobile viewing

### Strikethrough

- Use for showing corrections or outdated information
- Great for "common mistakes" sections
- Can highlight the evolution of ideas

### Autolinks

- Perfect for sharing additional resources
- No need to worry about markdown link syntax
- Just paste the URL and it becomes clickable

### Footnotes

- Use for additional explanations that might interrupt flow
- Great for references to textbook pages or external resources
- Automatically numbered and linked

### Tasklists

- Create interactive study guides
- Show course progress
- Outline lecture objectives
- Student self-assessment checklists

## Best Practices

1. **Tables**: Keep them simple and readable. For complex data, consider breaking into multiple tables.

2. **Strikethrough**: Don't overuse. Reserve for meaningful corrections or evolution of concepts.

3. **Autolinks**: Test links to ensure they work before publishing.

4. **Footnotes**: Keep them concise. If explanation is long, consider making it main content.

5. **Tasklists**: Update regularly so students can track their progress.

## Interactive Example with Tasklists

Try creating a weekly study checklist:

**Week 3: Functions and Relations**

- [ ] Monday: Read sections 3.1-3.2
- [ ] Tuesday: Watch video lecture on functions
- [ ] Wednesday: Complete odd-numbered problems
- [ ] Thursday: Review examples, attempt even problems
- [ ] Friday: Submit homework, start studying for quiz
- [ ] Weekend: Review notes, practice problems

Students can mentally check these off as they complete each task!

## Conclusion

All these features are now available in your MDX lecture notes. Mix and match them to create engaging, well-structured content for your students.
