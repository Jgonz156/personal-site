# Predicate Logic and Quantifiers

In this lecture, we extend propositional logic to **predicate logic**, which allows us to make statements about properties of objects and collections.

## Limitations of Propositional Logic

Propositional logic can't express statements like:

- "All students in this class are computer science majors"
- "There exists a prime number greater than 100"
- "Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes"

We need a more powerful system! Enter **predicate logic**.

## Predicates

A **predicate** is a statement that contains variables and becomes a proposition when the variables are assigned values.

### Examples

**P(x)**: "x is an even number"

- P(4) is **true** (4 is even)
- P(7) is **false** (7 is not even)
- P(x) by itself is neither true nor false

**Q(x, y)**: "x > y"

- Q(5, 3) is **true**
- Q(2, 8) is **false**

**R(x)**: "x is a programming language"

- R("Python") is **true**
- R("Banana") is **false**

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers allow us to make statements about entire sets.

### Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)

**$\forall x \, P(x)$** means "For all $x$, $P(x)$ is true"

Read as: "For every $x$" or "For all $x$"

#### Examples:

1. $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x \geq 0$

   - "All natural numbers are non-negative" ✓ TRUE

2. $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^2 \geq 0$

   - "The square of any integer is non-negative" ✓ TRUE

3. $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 > 0$
   - "The square of any real number is positive" ✗ FALSE (counterexample: $x = 0$)

### Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)

**$\exists x \, P(x)$** means "There exists an $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true"

Read as: "There exists an $x$" or "For some $x$"

#### Examples:

1. $\exists x \in \mathbb{N}, x^2 = 16$

   - "There exists a natural number whose square is 16" ✓ TRUE ($x = 4$)

2. $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}, 2x + 1 = 0$

   - "There exists an integer $x$ such that $2x + 1 = 0$" ✗ FALSE

3. $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 = 2$
   - "There exists a real number whose square is 2" ✓ TRUE ($x = \sqrt{2}$)

## Negating Quantified Statements

De Morgan's Laws extend to quantifiers!

### Negation Rules

$$
\neg(\forall x \, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \, \neg P(x)
$$

$$
\neg(\exists x \, P(x)) \equiv \forall x \, \neg P(x)
$$

### Examples

**Original**: $\forall x, x > 0$

- "All numbers are positive"

**Negation**: $\exists x, x \leq 0$

- "There exists a number that is not positive"

---

**Original**: $\exists x$, $x$ is a perfect square

- "There exists a perfect square"

**Negation**: $\forall x$, $x$ is not a perfect square

- "All numbers are not perfect squares" (equivalently: "No number is a perfect square")

---

## Multiple Quantifiers

We can combine multiple quantifiers for more complex statements.

### Order Matters!

**$\forall x \, \exists y, x < y$**

- "For every $x$, there exists a $y$ such that $x < y$"
- TRUE (for any number, we can find a larger one)

**$\exists y \, \forall x, x < y$**

- "There exists a $y$ such that for all $x$, $x < y$"
- FALSE (no single number is larger than ALL numbers)

### Examples with Multiple Quantifiers

1. **$\forall x \, \forall y, (x > 0 \land y > 0) \to xy > 0$**

   - "The product of any two positive numbers is positive"

2. **$\forall x \, \exists y, x + y = 0$**

   - "For every number, there exists an additive inverse"

3. **$\exists x \, \forall y, x \cdot y = y$**
   - "There exists a multiplicative identity" ($x = 1$)

---

## Domain of Discourse

The **domain** specifies which values variables can take.

### Example: Even Numbers

Let $P(x)$: "$x$ is even"

Different domains give different truth values:

- **Domain = $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$**: $\forall x \, P(x)$ is TRUE
- **Domain = $\mathbb{N}$**: $\forall x \, P(x)$ is FALSE
- **Domain = $\{2k \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$**: $\forall x \, P(x)$ is TRUE

> Always be clear about your domain!

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Translation

Translate to logical notation (let domain be $\mathbb{R}$):

a) "Every real number has a square"  
b) "There exists a number whose square is negative"  
c) "For every positive number, there exists a smaller positive number"

### Problem 2: Negation

Negate the following statements:

a) $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, \exists y \in \mathbb{N}, x + y = 10$  
b) $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0$  
c) $\forall$ students $s$, $s$ has submitted homework

### Problem 3: Truth Values

Determine if true or false (domain = $\mathbb{Z}$):

a) $\forall x \, \exists y, 2x + y = 5$  
b) $\exists x \, \forall y, x + y = x$  
c) $\forall x \, \forall y, (x < y) \to (x^2 < y^2)$

### Problem 4: Multiple Quantifiers

Explain the difference between:

a) $\forall x \, \exists y, x + y = 0$  
b) $\exists y \, \forall x, x + y = 0$

Which one is true for integers? Which one is false?

## Coming Up Next

In Lecture 4, we'll use our logical foundations to construct **mathematical proofs**. We'll learn direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by contrapositive.

The tools of logic we've built will be essential for proving theorems throughout the rest of the course!
