# Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

Welcome to CMSI 2820! This course covers the mathematical foundations essential for computer science.

## What is Discrete Mathematics?

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally **discrete** rather than continuous. In computer science, we work with:

- Finite sets of data
- Individual integers
- Distinct states in algorithms
- Separate steps in computations

> **Key Insight**: Unlike calculus (which deals with continuous change), discrete math focuses on countable, distinct elements.

## Course Structure

This course is organized around **7 core standards**:

1. **Logic** - Propositional logic, truth tables, predicates
2. **Numbers** - Number systems, modular arithmetic, primes
3. **Collections** - Sequences, summations, induction
4. **Functions** - Types, composition, cardinality
5. **Combinatorics** - Counting principles, permutations, combinations
6. **Graph Theory** - Representations, traversal, properties
7. **Set Theory** - Operations, Venn diagrams, identities

## Why Discrete Math Matters

### For Computer Science

Discrete math provides the foundation for:

- **Algorithm Analysis**: Understanding time and space complexity
- **Data Structures**: Trees, graphs, hash tables
- **Database Theory**: Relations, queries, normalization
- **Cryptography**: Number theory and modular arithmetic
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Logic and reasoning systems
- **Networking**: Graph theory for routing algorithms

### Example: Boolean Logic in Programming

```javascript
// JavaScript uses boolean logic from discrete math
if (isLoggedIn && hasPermission) {
  // Boolean AND operation
  console.log("Access granted")
}

// De Morgan's Laws apply here!
// !(A && B) is equivalent to !A || !B
if (!isLoggedIn || !hasPermission) {
  console.log("Access denied")
}
```

## Mathematical Notation

Throughout this course, we'll use standard mathematical notation:

| Symbol      | Meaning      | Example                              |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| $\forall$   | For all      | $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x \geq 0$ |
| $\exists$   | There exists | $\exists x \in \mathbb{N}, x^2 = 4$  |
| $\in$       | Element of   | $5 \in \mathbb{N}$                   |
| $\subseteq$ | Subset       | $A \subseteq B$                      |
| $\land$     | Logical AND  | $P \land Q$                          |
| $\lor$      | Logical OR   | $P \lor Q$                           |

## Getting Started

For this course, you should:

1. Review basic algebra and mathematical reasoning
2. Be comfortable with variables and expressions
3. Have a logical mindset for problem-solving
4. Be ready to write mathematical proofs

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Logic Basics

Determine if the following statement is true or false:

"If it is raining, then the ground is wet."

Can you think of a case where this might be false?

### Problem 2: Set Notation

Given the set $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, list all subsets of $A$ that contain exactly 2 elements.

### Problem 3: Boolean Logic

Simplify the following expression using boolean algebra:

$$
(A \land B) \lor (A \land \neg B)
$$

## Next Steps

In the next lecture, we'll dive deep into **propositional logic**, learning how to:

- Construct truth tables
- Identify logical equivalences
- Apply De Morgan's laws
- Work with conditional statements
