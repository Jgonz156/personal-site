# EXAM TEMPLATE - Use this as a starting point for new exam MDX files

This template demonstrates the structure for exam pages in the course site.
Exams are simpler than homeworks and focus on providing:

1. Information about the exam format and rules
2. Details about what's covered
3. A link to take the exam on Brightspace

METADATA EXPORT:

- Export a metadata object with exam details
- The exam number (exNumber) fetches date info from course-data.ts
- This ensures a single source of truth for dates

COMPONENTS:

- ExamIntro: Displays exam details and the "Take Exam" button
- ExamRules: Highlights important rules and guidelines
- MultiSelectQuestion: Optional, for example questions

================================================================================

export const metadata = {
  exNumber: 0, // Change to match your exam number
  title: "EX0: Exam Title Here",
  standard: "X (Standard Name)",
  topics: ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"],
  totalPoints: 10,
  totalQuestions: 5,
  hasTimer: false, // true if timed
  allowedAttempts: "Unlimited", // or "1", "2", "3", etc.
  examUrl: "https://brightspace.lmu.edu/...", // OPTIONAL: Only include for single-part exams
  // For multi-part exams (like midterms), omit examUrl and add separate links in the content
}

export const examEvent = getExamEvent(metadata.exNumber)

# INTRODUCTORY CONTENT

Before the ExamIntro component, you can add any explanatory text about:

- What the exam format is like
- General exam policies
- Example questions (using MultiSelectQuestion component)

# This section appears before the exam details card.

## About This Exam

Add any introductory content here to explain the exam format, rules, or provide context.

You can include example questions using the MultiSelectQuestion component:

<MultiSelectQuestion
  question="Example multiple choice question text here. Students can select multiple answers."
  choices={[
    "Option A - First choice",
    "Option B - Second choice",
    "Option C - Third choice",
    "Option D - Fourth choice",
  ]}
  answers={[1, 0, 1, 0]}
  incorrectMessage="Not quite! Review the material and try again."
  correctMessage="Correct! You've got it!"
/>

- Title and standard
