## About the Final Exam

This is the optional final exam that covers the last three standards: **Functions**, **Combinatorics**, and **Graph Theory**. Like the midterm, this exam is structured to give you flexibility in which sections you take.

Each section focuses on one standard and can be taken independently. You only need to take the sections for standards where you want to improve your grade.

The complete final is **15 questions total** and worth **30 points** if you take all three sections.

### Important Notes

- Covers **Standards 4, 5, and 6**
- Each section: **1 attempt** with a **30-minute timer**
- Timer accommodations are automatically reflected in Brightspace
- **Open everything** except soliciting answers (no Stack Overflow posts, no asking classmates)
- Take as many sections as you'd like - they're independent of each other!
