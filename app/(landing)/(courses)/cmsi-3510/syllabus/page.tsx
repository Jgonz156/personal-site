              This 4-unit course combines the modern development of Operating
              Systems with practical application in Rust. Topics include
              Concurrent and Parallel Programming, investigations of computer
              hardware architecture, Scheduling, Memory Management, I/O
              management, and other concepts relevant to the view of Kernel
              Systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course is offered in a synchronous, lecture-based format,
              meeting in person. Recordings of all lectures will be uploaded to
              the course site for asynchronous access, typically after class.
              You are encouraged to ask questions at any time during lectures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coursework consists of programming assignments, mandatory in-class
              activities, as well as optional creative projects and optional
              midterm and final assessments for additional credit. Collaboration
              is encouraged, but all submitted work must be your own original
              work. If you work with others or use outside sources, cite them
              appropriately so I can accurately assess each student&apos;s
              understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 4-unit course requires a minimum of 12 hours of work per
              week, in accordance with University policy. I encourage students
              to work consistently in manageable segments ("chiseling") to avoid
              last-minute stress. Homework assignments include checkpoints to
              help track progress and reinforce understanding.

            Modern computing often conceals its complexity behind layers of
            abstraction, allowing software engineers to treat systems as if they
            operate by "magic." In this course, we will strip away that sense of
            mystery by examining the principles and mechanisms that make modern
            computing possible. While the breadth of operating systems cannot be
            fully covered in a single semester, you will develop the following
            core competencies:

                Great question! I actually want to encourage "less" work by
                getting you all to work sooner in small chunks. Think about my
                grading system, if you do well on the homework by chiseling away
                at it early, you will avoid more than half of all the
                assignments and still get an A! So it might feel like the

                Yes. I'll be honest, the old system of keeping your tech out of
                sight so that I can monopolize your attention is pretty
                draconian (Old and reminiscent of Vampires). If a message that
                YOU think is important comes up and you feel you need to answer
                it, go ahead, just don't disrupt others is all. Also this is a
                computer science course, bit odd to have a policy against tech
                right?

                This is a bit of a loaded question. My big rule is not to
                disrupt anyone. If you can eat it without bothering those in
                your immediate area, then you are good to go. Foods that emit an
                "area of effect" so to speak are not allowed as they may be
                disruptive to others. I also retain the ability to stop anyone
                from eating at any time for the purposes of class activities or
                enforcing other university policies.

                While it may seem harsh, no. The course is made to provide all
                the opportunity necessary to succeed up front. If by the very
                end there is a serious issue we will work on it together, but if
                you are sitting at a B+ right on the edge of an A-, I will not
                invent work to boost your grade as it would be unfair to other
                students.

                No, you are all adult enough by now to make that decision for
                yourself. I'd highly recommend showing up because I constructed
                this class to center around the in-person experience. But I will
                not be docking your grade if you do not attend. The only
                detriment you will receive is from the awkwardness that arises
                from missing material.
